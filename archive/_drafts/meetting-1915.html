<p>It was great coming back to watch the team compete at the FIRST Robotics Greater DC Regional. Team 1915 continues to show improvements year after year. Though it might have gone to Nationals, I find it amazing how much spirit the team has showed in my times being and even now as an alumni. At the greater DC Regional I decided to volunteer to get a different perspective on the event. After all, I have spending the past four years in the pit/field and not getting much of the satisfaction of appreciating for the teams works and the venue. As a volunteer I was able to see so many various faces many of whom I remember still. All full of various displays of emotions ranging from frustration, anger and excitement.<br/> Though I can go on forever about how impressed I was with all the teams I much rather talk about how cool it was to see Team 1915 hold it together even after so many failures. <br/>
Just as ex
<br/>
At the Cheseapeake regional however, they scored a well deserved Judges award. It suffices to say that on their/our 10th Anniversary the fire is still burning.
