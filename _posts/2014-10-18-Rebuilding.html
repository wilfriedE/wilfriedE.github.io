<p>I decided to move away from wilfried.herokuapp.com to a github page at wilfriede.github.io aslso avaible now at wilfried.me </p>
<p>Mostly due to how slow my heroku hosting was. For now I will keep it up, and start moving my posts from wilfried.herokuapp.com to jekyll posts. My website should be fully functional again after that. wilfriede.me might also be impacted for the time being.</p>
